				<b>DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE:</b><br> The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market as of the specified date under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus.<br>
				 
				Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: buyer and seller are typically motivated; both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their own best interests; a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; payment is made in terms of cash in Canadian dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.<br> 
				(Source: Canadian Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice) Note: If other than market value is being appraised, see additional comments.<br> 
				DEFINITION OF HIGHEST AND BEST USE: The reasonably probable and legal use of the property, that is physically possible, appropriately supported, and financially feasible, and that results in the highest value.<br>
				 
				<b>PURPOSE OF THE APPRAISAL:</b><br>
				 
				This "drive-by" report has been prepared for the exclusive use of the client and other intended users named above. The client is aware that, as the degree of departure from a full appraisal report increases, there is a corresponding decrease in the level of reliability of the report, resulting in a higher level of risk for the user of the report. Due to the limitations of this reporting method, it is not intended for use by third parties and liability to any unintended users is expressly denied. The appraiser assumes diligence by all intended users.<br>
				 
				<b>SCOPE OF THE REPORT:</b><br>
				 
				 1.  The client has specifically requested a "drive-by" appraisal to be reported in an abbreviated report format. The Appraiser has been requested to perform an exterior inspection and not to 
				      disturb the occupants by entering the building.  Both the client and the appraiser understand that NEITHER A PHYSICAL INSPECTION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE SUBJECT 
				      PROPERTY NOR A STREET INSPECTION OF THE COMPARABLES HAS BEEN  PERFORMED (unless stated otherwise  herein).<br>
				 2.  It is acknowledged by both parties that a subsequent physical inspection of the interior of the subject property and/or a more in-depth investigation could result in a different conclusion.<br>
				 3.  The physical characteristics used to develop this appraisal are based on documents, records etc. described below and on other information provided by sources identified below. The 
				      subject property was observed only from  the public street and it is assumed that the information provided by the sources is accurate. Comments (on the efforts taken to obtain, and the source 
				      of, interior and exterior inspection information):<br>

		<div ng-hide="oToggleElementList['disclosures']">	
			<p>
				The certification that appears in this residential "drive-by" appraisal report is subject to the following conditions:<br>
				 1.  The appraiser will not be responsible for matters of a legal nature that affect either the property being appraised or the title to it. No registry office search has been performed and the appraiser 
				      assumes that the title is good and marketable and free and clear of all encumbrances including leases, unless otherwise noted in this report. The property is appraised on the basis of it being 
				      under responsible ownership.	<br>	
				 2.  Because market conditions change rapidly and, on occasion, without warning, the estimated market value range expressed as of the date of this appraisal cannot be relied upon as of any other 
				      date except with further advice from the appraiser confirmed in writing.<br>
				 3.  The subject property is presumed to comply with government regulations including zoning, building codes and health regulations and, if it doesn't comply, its non-compliance may affect market 
				      value.<br>
				 4.  The appraiser will not give testimony or appear in court concerning this appraisal unless required to do so by due process of law.<br>
				 5.  The appraiser has noted in this report any readily apparent adverse conditions that were observed during the street inspection of the subject property or that he or she became aware of during 
				      the normal research involved in performing this type of appraisal.<br>
				 6.  Unless otherwise stated in this report, the appraiser has no knowledge of any hidden or unapparent conditions of the property or adverse environmental conditions that would make the property 
				      more or less valuable and has assumed that there are no such conditions and makes no guarantees or warranties, express or implied, regarding the condition of the property. The appraiser will 
				      not be responsible for any such conditions that do exist or for any engineering or testing that might be required to discover whether such conditions exist. Because the appraiser is not an expert 
				      in the field of environmental hazards, this drive-by appraisal report must not be considered as an environmental assessment of the property. The bearing capacity of the soil is assumed to be 
				      adequate.	<br>
				 8.  The contents of this report are confidential and will not be disclosed by the author to any party except as provided for by the provisions of the Canadian Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal
				       Practice and with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice ("The Standards") and/or when properly entered into evidence of a duly qualified judicial or quasi-judicial body. The 
				       appraiser acknowledges that the information collected herein is personal and confidential and shall not disclose the contents of this report except as provided for in the provisions of both 
				       "Standards" (CUSPAP/ USPAP) and in accordance with the appraiser's privacy policy. The client agrees that in accepting this report, it shall maintain the confidentiality and privacy of any personal 
				       information contained herein and shall copy in all material respects with the contents of the appraiser's privacy policy.<br>
				 9.  The appraiser has agreed to enter into the assignment as requested by the client named in the report for the use specified by the client, which is stated in the report, which calls for things that 
				      are different from the work that would otherwise be required by The Standards. As this is a "drive-by" appraisal, only limited inspections have been undertaken (Extraordinary Limiting Condition). 
				     The client has agreed that the performance of this limited scope appraisal and the "drive-by" report format are appropriate for the intended use.<br>
				10. Written consent from the author and supervisory appraiser, if applicable, must be obtained before any part of the appraisal report can be used for any purpose by anyone except the client and 
				      other intended users identified in the report. Where the client is the mortgagee, liability is extended to its insurer. Liability to any other party or for any other use is expressly denied regardless of 
				      who pays the appraisal fee. Written consent and approval must also be obtained before the appraisal (or any part of it) can be altered or conveyed to other parties, including mortgagees (other 
				      than the client) and the public through prospectus, offering memoranda, advertising, public relations, news, sales or other media.<br>
				11. Any use which a third party makes of this report, or any reliance on or decisions made based on it are the responsibility of such third parties. The appraiser accepts no responsibility for damages, 
				      if any, suffered by any third party as a result of decisions made or  actions based on this report.<br>
				12. If transmitted electronically, this report will have been digitally signed and secured with personal passwords to lock the appraisal file. Due to the possibility of digital modification, only originally 
				      signed reports and those reports sent directly by the appraiser, can be relied upon without fault.<br>
				13. Other (including any other Extraordinary Assumptions and Limiting Conditions involved in this appraisal):
